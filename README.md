We can see the result of this project by placing the MultipleReducerUsers file in to our App.js file present in src folder,
Ensure before placing we should run our db.json file using the command
**npm i json-server -g**
Once installation done, then navigate to folder which our db.json file located, then give below command to deploy our dummy data base,
**npx json-server --watch db.json**(as I have created) **--port 3200**(Port number Which I have used as axios url)
Finally every React developer knows the command **npm start**
