1.**My requirement is**, Initially I have the count value is 10, count should be increase by 10 in every clicking of specific button  
2.Once the count value reached to 100, after that count shouldn't increase even by clicking the same button as above  
3.Here we go to achieve the requirement through React.JS  
4.Anyone can see the result of this requirement by simply place the file name called TargetCount.js in our React-Component name App.js of our React Project  
  
1.**One More Requrement is**, Same as we discussed above, but increasing of my count value should be controle by the start & stop buttons, then the count increment will be automatic instead of clicking every increment  
2.Don't worry, Here we go for this requirement simply take a look on the result by simply remove TargetCount.js or add AutoCountIncrement.js file at same location as mentioned in above in our React Project
